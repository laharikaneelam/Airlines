# Airlines
An airlines project has 2 applications one with flights and other with users.
Created a web application using Django, created models and migrated them to SQLite3 by registering them to the Django default Admin Interface for adding information to the models created. The page displays the flight links to the user and further displays the flight information and ability to add the non passengers to the passenger list.
